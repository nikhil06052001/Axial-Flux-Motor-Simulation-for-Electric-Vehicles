 Developed and simulated a high-performance axial flux permanent magnet-assisted induction motor
 (PMaIM) tailored for electric vehicle propulsion. Implemented 3D torque estimation using Maxwell
 stress tensor with axial flux tapering. Built MATLAB scripts for airgap flux density mapping, torque
 ripple minimization, and 3D visualization. Demonstrated potential for greater than 20% higher torque
 density and reduced motor size, supporting lightweight and efficient EV drivetrains.
